Flaw in explorer process.
	This is by far one of the stupidest things i've ever seen.
	So microsoft decided to prevent programs frm taskkilling explorer due to skids.
	Now once you try to do it, you'll notice it reopens righr away.
	Doesn't sound so stupid huh?
	Wrong. Let me give an example.
	Go ahead and type tskill explorer into cmd, you'll see it'll open right back up.
	Now here's the stupid part, You can end it by just running the command multiple times.
	Example: tskill explorer && tskill explorer && tskill explorer && tskill explorer && tskill explorer
	Now watch as it doesn't reopen. GG Microsoft, HAve fun skids! equin0x out.
